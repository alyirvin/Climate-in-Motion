# Climate Change Visualization Project
## Overview
This project provides an interactive platform to explore the impacts of climate change, focusing on global trends in temperature and precipitation. By analyzing datasets like the GISS Surface Temperature Analysis (GISTEMP v4), the project highlights historical and current environmental changes, offering a global and regional perspective. Users can dive into data visualizations that make climate change both accessible and personal, helping them understand its effects on their local areas.

## Purpose and Scope
The project addresses the pressing issue of climate change by presenting key data trends and patterns. Through interactive visualizations, it aims to raise awareness and provide actionable insights into the challenges posed by global warming, including rising temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and their associated impacts.

## Questions Explored
- How have global and regional temperatures and precipitation changed over time?
- Which regions face the highest exposure to climate-related phenomena, like extreme weather events?
- How do greenhouse gas emissions correlate with observed changes?
- How are extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, droughts, and wildfires, evolving globally?
  
## Features and Visualizations
- **Global Trends:** Explore how temperature and precipitation patterns have shifted worldwide.
- **Regional Focus:** Drill down into state and country-level data for a personal connection.
- **Interactive Graphs:** A dynamic map showing yearly precipitation changes across the globe, and line charts detailing trends for specific countries, including cropland exposure to extreme weather events.

## Data Sources
We used a range of high-quality datasets to ensure the accuracy and relevance of our findings:

- **GISS Surface Temperature Analysis (GISTEMP v4):** Tracks global and hemispheric temperature anomalies from 1880 to the present.
- **Global Seawater Oxygen-18 Database:** Contains over 26,000 data points on seawater attributes like temperature, salinity, and isotopic composition.
- **Extratropical Cyclones Database:** Provides detailed cyclone data, including detection date, location, and movement.
- **OECD Climate Exposure Data:** Assesses regional vulnerabilities to extreme precipitation, drought, wildfire, and other climate risks.

## Audience
The visualizations are designed for the general public, policymakers, educators, and climate enthusiasts. By providing clear and compelling insights, the project encourages users to better understand the local and global impacts of climate change.

## Goals
- Communicate complex climate data in an engaging and relatable way.
- Highlight local changes to inspire climate awareness and action.
- Support discussions on climate policy and sustainable practices.
